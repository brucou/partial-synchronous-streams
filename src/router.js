/**
 * Definition for a router component which :
 * - will pass the sinks of its children components iff the new route
 * matches the route configured for the components
 * - when the route no longer matches, components sinks are terminated
 * - when the route matches, changes but keeps the same value, children
 * sinks remain in place
 * Route information is read on the `route$` property
 * Children components pass to their own children a `route$` which is the
 * `route$` they received from their parent, from which they remove the
 * part of the route that they have matched (passing what is called here the
 * remainder).
 * Params parsed from the matched route are passed to the children
 * component through their `settings` parameters, with the `routeParams`
 * property.
 * The `route$` property can be but should not be manipulated directly out
 * of a `Router` component.
 *
 * Two settings are necessary :
 * - route : the route which triggers the component sinks activation.
 *   1. Note that a route value of `undefined` will produce no matching,
 *   while a value of `""` will match `":user"` ! See the tests
 *   2. Every new nested route will trigger the emission of a nested route
 *   value, even if that new nested route value is the same as the
 *   previous one.
 *   3. In the routed component, the `route$` will emit the matched
 *   portion of the route. However, the same information is already broken
 *   down in `routeParams` and should be read from there.
 *
 * - sinkNames : the list of sinks (names) which must be activated in
 * response to the matching route
 *
 * Note that the DOM sink will emit null on some specific circumstances,
 * hence the component receiving the routed DOM sink must plan for that
 * case accordingly. That means DOM :: Observable<VNode>|Null
 *
 * @param {Sources} sources
 * @param {{route: string, sinkNames: Array<string>, trace: string}} settings
